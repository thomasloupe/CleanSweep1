CleanSweep - Thomas Loupe - 2016

Please Note: This repository is read-only as an updated version of CleanSweep has been released at https://github.com/thomasloupe/CleanSweep.

CleanSweep is a lightweight python script that removes temp files from a Windows machine. It's extremely fast and efficient.

There are two modes you can run CleanSweep in:
1. Quick
2. Verbose

By running CleanSweep.exe, you run the application in its default "quick" mode. This mode does not ask for permission when deleting temp files. 
It skips any user input and performs the task.
Create a shortcut to the executable, and add --verbose or -v, and the application will prompt your approval to delete files before it does so.
It will then output a list of files it will delete into the console.

Source code is available in "CleanSweep.py".
